# LCD
Longitudinal Control Demonstrator
The LCD is a didactic wind tunnel model with 2 degrees of freedom, pitch and vertical displacement. 
It is designed to teach the relationship between Angle of Attack (AoA), Elevator Deflection and Airspeed.
The control box and the plane are connected through nRF24 modules, the control box displays the AoA (from plane accelerometer)
and the elevator deflection, which is controlled through a potentiometer.
